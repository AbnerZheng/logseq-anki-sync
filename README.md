# FAQ
<details>
 <summary>How to restore anki deck in case of accidental deletation?</summary>
 Anki automatically stores the last 50 backup (by default) in the folder <code>C:\Users\{WindowsUserName}\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\{AnkiProfileName}\backups</code>. You can restore your deck from there.

<details>
<summary>What fields are not safe to change?</summary>
   The oid-type and type fields in Anki notes must not be changed. You may change other fields but however on re-sync, they will get overwritten.<br>
   The things that dont get overwritten include: Scheduling, Flags, Bury, Suspend Information.<br>
   Also, all external cards that are not generated by the plugin are not affected in any way.<br>
</details>

 <summary>How does auto deletation work?</summary>
   First, each card created by the plugin in anki is marked as "created by plugin from this graph". A card is marked as "created by plugin" if it contains the by using the <code>${graphName}Model</code> identifer as model name. <br />
   Now, if a card is marked "created by plugin from this graph" but it is not available in the current graph, then the card is deleted.
